If this is visible I got Gatsby to render and generate routes for Markdown files! :happy:

I wanted to write about why I chose Gatsby to make this website instead of using some static content generator such as Jekyll or Hugo and some other things.

### Why Gatbsy at all for a simple blog?

\- *To be honest when I decided to create the site I was trying to use as much React as I could.*   

The good thing is that the framework takes care of routing. I do have to give them that, no need to use `react-router-dom` and their documentation  was really helpful.

I don't think I will switch to another framework for the foreseeable future. I thought for a second to switch to Next.js but I have a considerable amount of work here already. 

### The CSS is really plain and boring

\- *Yeah, I don't really have an idea of how I want to style this part of the site.*

I'm really happy with the front end. Rather than making everything outstanding and colorful, I'd like to style it to increase readability. Still need to spend some time working on it. I did change the font and looks way friendlier.

I just tested how much the `width` of the container makes everything look neat and compact. This definitely looks better on mobile!


### What's next?

\- *It works and looks nicely enough. Time to start writing!*

I think I will finish updating the front end and adding a tiny bit of css to the blog, specially to the blog post list.

**I do have to clean up the stylesheets.** They are currently a mess, instead of using `global.css` and overriding styles. Let the front end and blog have their own stylesheets.
